# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
- Louise's play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 
- Using the Kickstarter dataset, I visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals, and provide this written report based on my analysis and the visualizations created here.
